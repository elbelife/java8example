/**
 * Created by xiecong on 16/6/15.
 * A stream is something like an iterator. The values "flow past" (analogy to a stream of water) and then they're gone.
 * A stream can only be traversed once, then it's used up. Streams may also be infinite.
 * A stream provides a fluent API for transforming values and performing some action on the results.
 * Stream operations are either "intermediate" or "terminal".
